# Preface {.unnumbered}

The field of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is at the heart of understanding and improving the efficacy of interventions across diverse domains such as health, education, and social welfare. Over the years, the need for robust and context-sensitive evaluation frameworks has grown exponentially, as stakeholders demand tangible and evidence-based outcomes.

This book, *Practical M&E RCT Evaluations Techniques With R*, emerges from my personal journey and professional engagements in the M&E space. Inspired by real-world challenges and successes, it is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice. By focusing on replicable frameworks, data-driven insights, and the nuances of program contexts, I aim to provide readers with actionable tools for crafting impactful evaluations.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the many organizations, collaborators, and mentors who have shaped my understanding of M&E. I also wish to thank Blessman International for providing the cover image, which captures the essence of the community-driven efforts this book seeks to support.

Whether you are a student, researcher, program implementer, or policy advocate, this book offers a practical and adaptable approach to designing evaluations that inform and inspire change. Together, let us leverage the power of evaluation to create meaningful and sustainable impacts.

Sincerely,\
Victor Mandela Mokaya,
