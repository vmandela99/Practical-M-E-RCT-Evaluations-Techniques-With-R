Below, we outline the variables categorized into **Outcome Variables**, **Control Variables**, and **Other Variables**, ensuring they mirror the structure of a health program evaluation dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### **Outcome Variable**\n\nThis variable measures the primary goal of the SFP: improving school attendance.\n\n| **Variable**        | **Description**                                           |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **attendance_rate** | Average student attendance rate per school term (percent) |\n\n### **Control Variables**\n\nThese variables account for household and socio-economic factors that might influence school attendance or participation in the program.\n\n| **Variable**   | **Description**                                                       |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **age_hh**     | Age of the head of the household (in years)                           |\n| **age_sp**     | Age of the spouse (in years)                                          |\n| **educ_hh**    | Education of the head of the household (completed years of schooling) |\n| **educ_sp**    | Education of the spouse (completed years of schooling)                |\n| **female_hh**  | Head of the household is a woman (0=no, 1=yes)                        |\n| **indigenous** | Head of household speaks an indigenous language (0=no, 1=yes)         |\n| **hhsize**     | Number of household members (baseline)                                |\n| **dirtfloor**  | Home has a dirt floor at baseline (0=no, 1=yes)                       |\n| **bathroom**   | Home with private bathroom at baseline (0=no, 1=yes)                  |\n| **land**       | Number of hectares of land owned by household at baseline             |\n\n### **Other Variables**\n\nThese variables define the experimental design, program eligibility, and participation details.\n\n| **Variable**             | **Description**                                                                         |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **locality_identifier**  | Locality identifier                                                                     |\n| **household_identifier** | Unique household identifier                                                             |\n| **treatment_locality**   | School is in a locality with the feeding program (0=no, 1=yes)                          |\n| **promotion_locality**   | School is in a locality where the feeding program was promoted (0=no, 1=yes)            |\n| **eligible**             | Household is eligible for the feeding program (0=no, 1=yes)                             |\n| **enrolled**             | Child is enrolled in the feeding program (0=no, 1=yes)                                  |\n| **enrolled_rp**          | Child enrolled in the feeding program under the random promotion scenario (0=no, 1=yes) |\n| **poverty_index**        | Poverty Index 1-100                                                                     |\n| **round**                | Survey round (0=baseline; 1=follow-up)                                                  |\n| **hospital**             | HH member visited hospital in the past year (0=no, 1=yes)                               |\n\nThis comprehensive set of variables enables a detailed analysis of the program’s impact while controlling for household-level differences and program design elements. By aligning the variable structure with the program’s objectives, we can effectively measure the success of the intervention and uncover insights for future implementation.\n\n## \n",
