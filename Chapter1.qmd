## Variable Definitions

In designing the evaluation framework for the **School Feeding Program (SFP)**, it is essential to define variables that align with the program’s goals and context. Below, we outline the variables categorized into **Outcome Variables**, **Control Variables**, and **Other Variables**, ensuring they mirror the structure of a health program evaluation dataset.

theme_set(ggpubr::theme_pubclean())

# subset data to only "eligible" units
df_elig <- trans_df %>%
  filter(eligible == 1)
```

### **Outcome Variable**

This variable measures the primary goal of the SFP: improving school attendance.

| **Variable**        | **Description**                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **attendance_rate** | Average student attendance rate per school term (percent) |

### **Control Variables**

These variables account for household and socio-economic factors that might influence school attendance or participation in the program.

| **Variable**   | **Description**                                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **age_hh**     | Age of the head of the household (in years)                           |
| **age_sp**     | Age of the spouse (in years)                                          |
| **educ_hh**    | Education of the head of the household (completed years of schooling) |
| **educ_sp**    | Education of the spouse (completed years of schooling)                |
| **female_hh**  | Head of the household is a woman (0=no, 1=yes)                        |
| **indigenous** | Head of household speaks an indigenous language (0=no, 1=yes)         |
| **hhsize**     | Number of household members (baseline)                                |
| **dirtfloor**  | Home has a dirt floor at baseline (0=no, 1=yes)                       |
| **bathroom**   | Home with private bathroom at baseline (0=no, 1=yes)                  |
| **land**       | Number of hectares of land owned by household at baseline             |

### **Other Variables**

These variables define the experimental design, program eligibility, and participation details.

| **Variable**             | **Description**                                                                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **locality_identifier**  | Locality identifier                                                                     |
| **household_identifier** | Unique household identifier                                                             |
| **treatment_locality**   | School is in a locality with the feeding program (0=no, 1=yes)                          |
| **promotion_locality**   | School is in a locality where the feeding program was promoted (0=no, 1=yes)            |
| **eligible**             | Household is eligible for the feeding program (0=no, 1=yes)                             |
| **enrolled**             | Child is enrolled in the feeding program (0=no, 1=yes)                                  |
| **enrolled_rp**          | Child enrolled in the feeding program under the random promotion scenario (0=no, 1=yes) |
| **poverty_index**        | Poverty Index 1-100                                                                     |
| **round**                | Survey round (0=baseline; 1=follow-up)                                                  |
| **hospital**             | HH member visited hospital in the past year (0=no, 1=yes)                               |

This comprehensive set of variables enables a detailed analysis of the program’s impact while controlling for household-level differences and program design elements. By aligning the variable structure with the program’s objectives, we can effectively measure the success of the intervention and uncover insights for future implementation.
